Ohhhh oohhh
In the Begining god created heaven and earth
Then he made a garden of Eden
All four season and saw it was good
Then he took a little gauze and created people just like us
Then said go and spread the word of love
All over the world

He called them man and woman
Woman and man
Been together since time began
Man and woman, woman and man
Always doing the best they can
The best they can, oohhh

Eve picked the apple said to Adam
Hey why don't you try
Although he knew that it was forbidden by the father
He took a bite
And when god called them both by name
They had to run and hide from sin and shame
Since then nothing ever been the same, all over the world

He called them man and woman
Woman and man
Been together since time began
Man and woman, woman and man
Always doing the best they can
The best they can, oohhh

Spread the word all over the land
Tell everybody about the woman and man
Yeah, gods own creation

Spread the word all over the land
Tell everybody about the garden of eden
Yeah and all four seasons
Spread the word all over the land
Spread the word all over the land
Yeah... yeah... yeah.
