Why I man can tell u now me haffi good time
Cause I man wi look into di big sunshine
So why should I go to Paris? I'm on di island under sunny skies... wowowowowow
Why should I go to Paris? I man wi better think twice
Why I man can tell u now me haffi good mood
Cause irie attitude mek me really feel good
So, why should I go to Paris? Tell it to the stars in the skies above
Then I here a sweet voice working on me like a magic call of love

Da da da daba daba dab daba daba dab
Da da da daba daba dab daba daba dab
Da da da daba daba dab daba daba dab
Da da da da da da do

Why I man now tell myself: "I'm lucky and free"
For I don't wanna think of di woman who left me
But, something inside of me won't stop tellin' me: "jerry, go!"... wowowowowow
Something inside of me just keep's tellin me: "no"
Why di woman deal wid man like dem no see
Why di woman deal wid man like dem-a-be crazy
Now, why should I go to Paris? Tell it to the stars in the skies above
Then I here a sweet voice working on me like a magic call of love

Love after Love mi baby more and some more
Cool summer wind under the warm lovely sun
Oh baby why fi I go to paris for more
All I have to do is baby ask 4 more
Why should I go to Paris? Tell it to the stars in the skies above
Then I here a sweet voice working on me like a magic call of love
