There's someone looking back at you
Watching everything you do
It's the mirror man, ah-ha
And something's ringing in your ears
The sadder words, and I wonder what could have been, ah-ha

You can ask yourself the question
Tell yourself a lie
It's an easy comprehension
You know we fade and die without love

Take a man and woman
Put them soul to soul
Lead them by the hand till they know where they want to go
We don't need a perfect union or the blessing from above
But don't let us live in a world without love

Every lesson that you learn
Is echoed in another world
For the mirror man, ah-ha
Far behind the place you are
A turn toward that shining out that should have been, ah-ha

Take a good look in that mirror
Do the eyes return your stare?
Is the face a perfect stranger
Who had no need to care about love?
Oh

Take a man and woman
Put them soul to soul
Lead them by the hand till they know where they want to go
We don't need a perfect union or the blessing from above
But don't let us live in a world without love

Ask yourself the question (ask yourself the question)
Tell yourself a lie (tell yourself a lie)
Without love we fade

Take a man and woman (man and woman)
Put them soul to soul (soul to soul)
Lead them by the hand till they know where they want to go
We don't need a perfect union or the blessing from above (oh no)
But don't let us live in a world without love
Don't make it a world without love

Take a man and woman (man and woman)
Put them soul to soul (soul to soul)
Lead them by the hand till they know where they want to go
We don't need a perfect union or the blessing from above (oh no)
But don't let us live in a world without love

Take a man and woman
Put them soul to soul
Lead them by the hand till they know where they want to go
We don't need a perfect union, blessing from above
Don't let us live in a world without love
